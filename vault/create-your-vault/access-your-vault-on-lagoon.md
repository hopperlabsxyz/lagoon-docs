# Access your vault on Lagoon

## Manage your Vault

On your vault page, if you are connected as the Admin, Valuation Oracle or Curator you will see a blue button on the right side of the header with written Manage. Click on it to be redirected to the management page.

* Execute [settlements](../../overview/terminology.md#vault-settlement) (as [Currator](../roles-and-capacities/curator.md)).&#x20;
