# Create your vault

You can find the supported chains and factories addresses [here](../../resources/networks-and-addresses.md).

Lagoon provides all the tools to permissionlessly deploy and manage a vault. Before deploying a vault, we advice curators to read carefully the documentation and especially the [Deposit and Wtihdraw flows](../deposit-and-withdraw-flows.md) and the [Vault Valuation section](../vault-valuation.md).

When you are ready, you can deploy it directly via [Lagoon interface](https://app.lagoon.finance/deploy) or via [Etherscan](via-etherscan.md).
