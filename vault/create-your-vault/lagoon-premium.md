# Lagoon Premium

Lagoon provides the vault infrastructure; each curator defines their own approach to:

* **Governance** - distributed or centralized
* **Strategy** - across any asset, protocol, chain, or even CEX
* **Execution** - via AI agents, manual oversight, or algorithmic systems
* **Valuation** - on- or off-chain, automated or manual

Accurate, consistent, and timely valuation of shares is critical, not only to ensure a seamless experience for depositors but also to safeguard reputation and maintain trust.

That's why we created Lagoon Premium: a modular offering designed to leverage our expertise and provide technical support to curators.

#### Lagoon Premium covers:

* Wallet onboarding
* Permissions setup
* Net Asset Value (NAV) Updates & Calculation logic

With Lagoon Premium, you focus on what matters: running and growing your vault to maximize value creation. We handle the heavy lifting.
