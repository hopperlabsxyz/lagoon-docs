# What is Lagoon?

### Why Lagoon? <a href="#why-lagoon" id="why-lagoon"></a>

Managing on-chain assets for third parties today typically relies on two approaches:

* **Segregated Managed Accounts (SMAs)** using tools like **Safe** or MPC custodians.
* **Fully on-chain tokenized fund protocols (Vault-ERC4626)** that wrap strategies into ERC-20 vault tokens.

Each approach has limitations:

**SMAs** are not designed to scale. Managing thousands (or millions) of user wallets is almost impossible operationally, requiring constant coordination between the curator and each user for deposits, withdrawals, and strategy changes. Delays or missed communications can lead to lost yield—or worse, capital loss.

**Fully on-chain tokenized fund protocols**, while more scalable, often come with rigid infrastructure. They require new specific development integration with each DeFi protocol individually, introducing additional smart contract needed to be audit and reducing agility for curators. This restricts their ability to move quickly and capitalize on market opportunities.

## Lagoon at a glance

* Lagoon is an EVM vault technology based on asynchronous vault (7540 standard).
* Curators can independently deploy vaults on supported chains using the [**Lagoon Vault Factory**](/broken/pages/1uX1bXCjUHCCIjzAuoYl).
* Execute **any** strategy with maximum flexibility.
* Management and performance fee mechanism.
* Role based management of the vault (valuation oracle, curator, admin).

With Lagoon, curators regain full control over their strategies without sacrificing scalability or security.
